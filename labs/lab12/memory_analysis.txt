The steps for this process were in-step with Lab 11 and the processes we followed there. We added the additional linux_check commands to supplement our investigation. I was able to recreate everything the author did in the book, demonstrated by my txt files. For Project 2, I think I will supplement a few commands with grep to search for keywords in the memory analysis commands. For example, it may be helpful to use grep for linux_bash and look for any hooks. That's just one example, but the idea is to supplement these commands and look for clues of any common ways that might show a system was compromised.
