This is a relatively new server built on Apache 2 and MySQL. The hardware itself was purchased from a local computer company. The machine was wiped, Linux replaced the Windows 7 OS, and then sold to PAS. The web software is written in PHP. I already know PHP and MySQL have some severe vulnerabilities if used by someone with limited experience. Given the customer recently started to use Linux, PHP, and MySQL, I would make some assumptions that these are vulnerable attack vectors. 

Questions I would ask:
When did you first notice the issue?
Are there any additional ports, services, etc that you run on the server? Ie, what would the administrator consider normal?
Has anyone else had access to the server recently? Repair team? IT team? Anyone at all?
How does the server connect to the network? Here I'm looking for possible attack vectors or points of entry.
