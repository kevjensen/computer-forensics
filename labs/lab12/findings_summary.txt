Well I think it's obvious, like most folks, that I got the gist of what happened but probably missed some of the subtle details of the attack. For this project, I'm most excited about the opportunity to start with a blank slate. I'll have no guidance going into it. Nothing to guide me if I get stuck. So, first and foremost, I'm excited for the challenge. Second, based on the author's report, I will definitely truncate some of my findings and provide them in a more digestable format that I would present to a client at the end of an assignment. In particular, I do like the assigned rating of "Urgent", "Important", etc to help a client understand what the risks they're facing. In project 01, I think I made everything sound like a doomsday threat, which wouldn't help a client in practice. In addition, I also presented my previous summary in a "school" way that wouldn't make too much sense out of the classroom context. I really want to provide a professional report that I could show to employer after grad school and say, "Hey, this is what I can do." Finally, I really want to work on my live-analysis. I think I have a really good grasp on dead-analysis, but I'd like to improve what I can glean from the target machine in live-analysis. For a variety of reasons. The most important being that you only get one shot at a live-analysis. Sure, some of it will probably survive to the dead analysis, but I feel that I squandered so much of the information I learned from live-analysis in project 01. I don't want to make that same mistake again.
