They run the live analysis much like we did for PFE. In particular, they find a few interesting things. First, a shell listening on port 44965 indicates a backddor has been planted. Second, a new user called "mysqll" with root privileges has been created. The system is clearly compromised. The investigation also found dozens of failed log-in attempts, though it is not clear if this was attempted before or after the backdoor had been installed.
